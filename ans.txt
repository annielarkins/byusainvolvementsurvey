Hello @Rahul ,

Solution using php and Qualtrics api 

Step 1: Get the response of survey in csv format by following [this link ](https://api.qualtrics.com/docs/create-response-export "this link ") and implement it using  curl in php 

Step 2: Follow [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/937912/writing-a-php-file-to-read-from-csv-and-execute-sql-query "this link") and implement same in the same php file.

Step 3: Now you have a php file which will pull the response(using step 1) and put into sql(using step 2). You can run this when you want it. 
In order to schedule it you can use [cron jobs](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/managing-cron-jobs-with-php--net-19428 "cron jobs") in php
